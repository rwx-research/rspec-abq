# How does ABQ & its protocol work?
# ======================================
# This is a reframing of some of https://www.notion.so/rwx/Native-Runner-Protocol-0-2-d992ef3b4fde4289b02244c1b89a8cc7
# With pointers to where it is implemented in this codebase.
#
# One or more abq workers each launch a "native runner" (in this case, rspec).
# one of the native runners is designated the one to produce a manifest (via an environmental variable).
#
# Each native runner is passed a socket address as an environmental variable to communicate with its worker.
# The first message sent over the socket is the NATIVE_RUNNER_SPAWNED_MESSAGE, sent from the native runner to the worker.
# (see: `Abq.socket`)
#
# The Manifest
# ------------
# The manifest is used by the abq supervisor to coordinate workers.
# The manifest contains
# - a list of all the tests to run. Each worker will receive a slice of these tests.
# - native-runner specific information for configuring workers. In RSPec's case -- we send ordering information to ensure
#   each instance of rspec orders its specs consistently
#
# The manifest is written in the monkey-patched RSpec::Core::Runner#run_specs method (see `RSpec::Abq::Extensions::Runner`)
#
# After the manifest has been generated and sent to the worker, that native runner quits and is relaunched fresh as as a
# non-manifest-generating worker.
#
# "Normal" Native Runners
# -----------------------
# Non-manifest-generating native runners first perform an initialization handshake, fetching init message from the worker,
# which either has config information or instructions for abq to quit early.
# (see: `Abq.configure_rspec`)
#
# After that, native runners fetch test cases from the worker, and send back test results.
# RSpec will iterate over all tests, but running only those that the worker tells it to run and skipping the rest.
# It will quit when all tests have been iterated over.
#
# Loading rspec-abq
# ========================
# The gem itself is usually loaded when `require spec_helper.rb` is called (either explicitly via `require rspec/abq` or
# implicitly via the Gemfile).
# The spec_helper is usually loaded in one of two ways:
# - via a `--require spec_helper` in the .rspec file, which means the gem is loaded BEFORE specs are loaded
# - or via a `require spec_helper.rb` in the spec itself, which means the gem is loaded WHILE specs are actively being loaded.
#
# In either case: the manifest cannot be written until AFTER specs are loaded, so all that loading the gem does is
# - check if rspec is being run via an abq worker
# - and if so, monkey patch rspec to hook in rspec-abq functionality
#
# Once rspec is patched ...
#
# First run manifest generation against the native runner on a single worker:
# - configure hard-coded rspec settings (Abq.configure_rspec) called from RSpec::Abq::Extensions::World#ordered_example_groups
# - generate the manifest via RSpec::Abq::Extensions::Runner#run_specs
# (the native runner quits)
#
# Then run the native runner again on one or more workers:
# - configure static rspec settings, plus settings fetched from the init_message in the manifest.
# - then fetch and test cases from the worker and send back test results until there are no tests left
